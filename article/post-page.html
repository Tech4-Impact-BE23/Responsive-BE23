        <p class="post-text">The U.S. Federal Reserve will announce its latest monetary policy decision on Wednesday, closely followed by the European Central Bank on Thursday. Central banks around the world have been aggressively raising interest rates for over a year in a bid to curb sky-high inflation, but economists warned in recent days that price pressures look likely to remain higher for longer.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The WEF Chief Economists Outlook report published Monday highlighted that inflation remains a primary concern. Almost 80% of chief economists surveyed said central banks face “a trade-off between managing inflation and maintaining financial sector stability,” while a similar proportion expects central banks to struggle to reach their inflation targets.</p>
        <p class="post-text">“Most chief economists are expecting that central banks will have to play a very delicate dance between wanting to bring down inflation further and the financial stability concerns that have also arisen in the last few months,” Zahidi told CNBC Monday.</p>
        <p class="post-text">As a result, she explained, that trade-off will become harder to navigate, with around three quarters of economists polled expecting inflation to remain high, or central banks to be unable to move fast enough to bring it down to target.</p>
        <p class="post-text">First Republic Bank became the latest casualty over the weekend, the third among mid-sized U.S. banks after the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March. This time, it was JPMorgan Chase
            that rode to the rescue, the Wall Street giant winning a weekend auction for the embattled regional lender after it was seized by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.</p>
        <p class="post-text">CEO Jamie Dimon claimed the resolution marked the end of the recent market turbulence as JPMorgan Chase acquired nearly all of First Republic's deposits and a majority of its assets.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Yet several leading economists told a panel at the World Economic Forum Growth Summit in Geneva on Tuesday that higher inflation and greater financial instability are here to stay.</p>
        <p class="post-text">“People haven't pivoted to this new era, that we have an era that will be structurally more inflationary, a world of post-globalization where we won't have the same scale of trade, there'll be more trade barriers, an older demographic that means that the retirees who are savers aren't saving the same way,” said Karen Harris, managing director of macro trends at Bain & Company.</p>
